Carseats Data Analysis
-----------------------
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from a carseats dataset. The goal is to explore relationships between various factors like population, shelf location, advertising spend, and profit. Key insights are drawn from scatter plots and metrics such as ROI (Return on Investment) to assess the effectiveness of advertising efforts and overall product performance.

The analysis is broken down into several visualizations that help identify trends, highlight high-performing product categories, and provide actionable recommendations for business strategy.
